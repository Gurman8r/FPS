First Person Shooter Framework in Unity

Press 'Escape' in game for settings and a list of controls.

Ideas, Goals, & Intentions:
		- Design and implement a robust combat system.
		- Ideally, it should be easily exportable into new, non-FPS projects.
	
		- Build flexible in-game menus for settings & such.
	
		- Experiment with building in-game editor tools
		- I want to try to make a map editor, something like Halo Forge.
	
		- Use Rewired to enable user defined controls.
